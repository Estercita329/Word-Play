# WordPlay Exercise


#### By _**Ester Tataje**_

## Description

Created a form where users may enter a sentence.
Turn that sentence into an array using the split method.
Then, loop through this array to build a new array out of every word in the sentence that is 3 or more characters in length.
Finally, reverse the order of the new array, join it back together into a string, and display it to the user.
